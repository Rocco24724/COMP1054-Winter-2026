        <h1>Ghost</h1>
        <h2>Tigers Jaw</h2>

        <h2>Will Yip</h2>

        <h3>Track 7 on</h3>
        <h2>Lost on You</h2>
    </section>

    <h2>[Intro]</h2>
    <p>I saw a ghost from the porch of my parents' house</p>
    <p>And there's so many things that I just can't be sure about</p>
    <p>But you went along with it, you didn't question a thing</p>

    <h2>[Verse 1]</h2>
    <p>I gave a name to my pain, hoping that I could push it away</p>
    <p>But, of course, it stayed</p>
    <p>It hits in waves at first, and then all at once</p>
    <p>Stood alone in the silence of what I had lost</p>
    <p>Tried to find whoever told my mind</p>
    <p>To speed up, to speed up, to speed up</p>

    <h2>[Chorus]</h2>
    <p>You arrive at the gate</p>
    <p>And they turn you away</p>
    <p>And you're crushed by the weight</p>
    <p>Of the games that they play</p>
    <p>They deprive you of it</p>
    <p>Then sell you a supplement</p>

    <h2>[Verse 2]</h2>
    <p>You turned around, I was halfway down River Street</p>
    <p>Said, "I need to leave, this apartment is killing me"</p>
    <p>Opened the door to my doubt and I let it all in</p>
    <p>I breathe in and breathe out before heading back in</p>
    <p>Always one step behind</p>
    <p>Wondering when I'll get out, I'll get out, I'll get out</p>

    <h2>[Chorus]</h2>
    <p>You arrive at the gate</p>
    <p>And they turn you away</p>
    <p>And you're crushed by the weight</p>
    <p>Of the games that they play</p>
    <p>They deprive you of it</p>
    <p>Then sell you a supplement</p>

    <h2>[Chorus]</h2>
    <p>You arrive at the gate</p>
    <p>And they turn you away</p>
    <p>And you're crushed by the weight</p>
    <p>Of the games that they play</p>
    <p>They deprive you of it</p>
    <p>Then sell you a supplement</p>

    <h1>About Tiger Jaw's hit song "Ghost"</h1>
    <P>The song "Ghost" is the seventh track on Tiger Jaw's upcoming album "Lost on You" planned for release on March 27, 2026. According to Tiger Jaw the song "Ghost" was inspired by their ability to turn personal experiences into a widely understood sentiment. Ben Walsh of Tiger Jaw explains, “The genesis of "Ghost" was a chance run-in with a person I grew up with. A run-in that would have been warm, welcomed and cherished at one point in my life held no significance after the slow steady passage of time and growing apart. The quick flash of memories with this person felt like a glimpse into a past life, or like seeing a ghost. Some people don't stay in your life forever and that's OK, but it's very interesting which memories get dredged up when you see a once familiar face.”</P>
